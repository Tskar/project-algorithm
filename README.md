# Project Algorithm

I build this project to allow users to have a fun experience understanding common sorting algorithms. You can access the app here:
https://Tskar.github.io/project-algorithm

## Project description

In the project, you can mess around with basic upside down bars that are arranged randomly. Just pick an algorithm you would like to see arrange the bars, and hit the sort button.
The app will execute rearranging the bars based on their height and the algorithm picked. You can also edit the speed and the numbers of bars in the screen to get a better understanding.
